# HCBL - Human Creative Burst Log

## About HCBL

The Human Creative Burst Log (HCBL) project aims to map, analyze, and visualize the spontaneous creative bursts that define human innovation. By logging bursts and identifying patterns of novelty and anomaly, HCBL forms the foundation for recursive memory fields and future dream architectures.

## What is a Burst?
A burst is a sudden, nonlinear expression of creativity, insight, or emotional resonance. In HCBL, each burst is treated as a unit of meaning.

## Why Detect Novelty and Anomalies?
- Novelty detection uncovers emerging creative directions.
- Anomaly detection identifies noise or signal drift.

## Quick Start

1. Install dependencies (scikit-learn, matplotlib, numpy).
2. Run the `dynamic_threshold_pipeline.py` to analyze bursts.
3. Visualize the burst landscape and tag novelty.

## Fine-Tuning and Expansion
- Use real sentence embeddings for bursts.
- Introduce dynamic thresholding and hyperparameter tuning.
- Plan for scalable pipelines with streaming data.

## The Future of Recursive Creativity Archives
HCBL is not just a project â€” it's the beginning of capturing the living memory of human thought. Join us in building recursive fields of dreams.
