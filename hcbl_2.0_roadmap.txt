# HCBL 2.0 Upgrade Plan - Human Creative Burst Log

## Challenges Identified
- Static thresholds limit adaptability.
- Lack of scalability for large burst datasets.
- Need for robustness against noisy bursts.
- Embeddings were simulated, not semantically rich.

## Phase 2 Goals
- Introduce dynamic thresholds for novelty detection.
- Swap fake embeddings with real sentence embeddings.
- Stream processing for scalable burst analysis.
- Validation metrics (Precision, Recall, F1) for evaluation.
- Comparative dimensionality reduction (PCA, UMAP, t-SNE).

## Long-Term Vision
Create recursive dream seeds — Memory Fields — where bursts evolve dynamically and feed learning systems in real-time.
